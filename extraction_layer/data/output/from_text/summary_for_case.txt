Charities whose purpose is environmental protection and poverty relief can adopt an investment policy that excludes certain investments. The Ashden Trust and Mark Leonard Trust are two such charities seeking the court's approval for their new investment policies. The court is determining the issues in the context of the Paris Climate Agreement, which aims to limit global warming.

The Paris Agreement asked the IPCC to produce a special report on the difference in effect of 2°C and 15°C warming. The IPCC published its report in October 2018, which said that a major shift in investment patterns is required to pursue 15°C mitigation efforts. Private persons and charities are not bound to the Paris Agreement, but can use it as a basis for assessing their investments.

The Mark Leonard Trust and Ashden Trust have powers to invest in various investments and property. The current investment policies exclude investments that contribute to climate change. The claimants are still invested in shares that conflict with the trusts' charitable purposes of advancing environmental protection.

The claimants have developed a proposed investment policy to ensure investments are aligned with the goals of the Paris Agreement. The policy seeks to protect and enhance the trust's financial returns and support its charitable objectives. It also aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions intensity and increase exposure to sustainable investments.

The proposed investment policy divides emissions into three scopes and requires companies to meet the Paris Climate Agreement to be eligible for investment. It also excludes investments in certain industries and requires the portfolio to outperform relevant benchmarks. The proposed portfolio was presented to the Ashden Trust trustees and accepted by Cazenove.

The trustees expressed concerns about the concentration of the portfolio in direct equities at a meeting on 1 May 2020. Cazenove outlined three options that complied with the proposed investment policy and the trustees' instruction. The trustees preferred option 3, which had the highest overall costs and volatility, as the baseline for implementation of the proposed investment policy.

Charities can invest ethically as long as it is in the charity's best interests and does not conflict with its aims. Trustees must assess the risk of lower returns against the risk of alienating support or damage to reputation. Ethical investment approaches may involve negative or positive screening, or stakeholder activism.

Trustees of charities have discretion to invest assets in a way that furthers the charity's purpose. The law must protect all charities regardless of size or purpose. Trustees owe fiduciary duties to the charitable purposes or objects of the charity.

The Attorney General represents the Crown as parens patriae and can enforce trustees' duties in the public interest. Trustees must consider the standard investment criteria when exercising their power of investment. Social investments, introduced by the Charities Protection and Social Investment Act 2016, are a hybrid form of investment that charities can make.

The Bishop of Oxford case is the only reported case dealing with ethical investments by charities. The vicechancellor set out the fundamental principle underlying the exercise of any power by charity trustees, which is that they must further the objects of the charity. The vicechancellor refused to make the declarations asked for by the claimants as they were ambiguous and lacked necessity.

Trustees have powers vested in them to further the purposes of the trust. Maximising financial return is the starting point for all charity trustees when considering the exercise of investment powers. Trustees should not invest in companies that directly conflict with the charity's purposes, even if it would result in financial detriment.

Trustees must balance the risk of financial detriment when making investment decisions. Trustees must not use trust assets to make moral statements at the expense of the charity. Trustees may take non-financial considerations into account, provided it does not involve significant risk of financial detriment.

Trustees should consider financial detriment, potential loss of supporters or beneficiaries, and whether investments conflict with the charity's objects when deciding on their investment policy. The vicechancellor in the Bishop of Oxford case did not lay down a threshold test for trustees to consider before anything else. Directly conflicting investments may be automatically excluded, but there are difficulties in defining and identifying such investments.

The Vicechancellor was discussing the unlikelihood of financial detriment if trustees excluded directly conflicting investments. He also discussed the balancing exercise trustees must perform when considering the indirect effect of particular investments. Lastly, he rejected the second declaration that the Church Commissioners may not act in a manner which would be incompatible with the charity's purpose.

Trustees must exercise their power of investment to further the charitable purposes. Trustees must consider the suitability of investments and the need for diversification when making decisions. Trustees must balance all relevant factors when making decisions involving potential conflicts or reputational damage.

This case is about the court's blessing of a proposed investment policy for a charity. The claimants applied under category 2 of Public Trustee v Cooper, which is a declaration that the trustees' proposed exercise of power is lawful. The court has no discretion in making the declaration, but may refuse to entertain the application if it considers the trustees' decision to be of insufficient moment.

The Honourable Mr Justice Michael Green approved the judgment in Butlersloss and Ors v Charity Commission for England and Wales and Anor. The claimants had decided to adopt the proposed investment policy subject to the court's approval. The claimants had to perform a discretionary exercise to balance the potentially conflicting investments against the risk of financial detriment.

The trustees of the charities have decided to adopt a proposed investment policy to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The decision was made taking into account all relevant factors and not taking into account irrelevant factors. The court has given its blessing to the decision and declared that the trustees are permitted to adopt the proposed investment policy.
