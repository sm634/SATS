else clearly financial detriment arising out of the pursuit of a particular investment policy is an important factor that trustees need to consider when balancing all the relevant factors but there is a danger in treating the words of the vicechancellor as though they are statutory requirements and prescriptive the important issue for this case arising out of the bishop of oxford case is whether there is an absolute prohibition against making investments that directly conflict with the charity’s purposes or objects ie whether there is a category conflict or whether it is always a discretionary exercise by trustees and a direct conflict is a major but not decisive factor in the balancing process to a certain extent the view that the claimants have taken as to the meaning and effect of the vicechancellor’s judgment as imposing an absolute prohibition has shaped their application to the court and their evidence starting from the perspective that investments that directly conflict with their charitable purposes must automatically be excluded they have sought to define what those investments are they have concluded that any investments that do not align with the goals of the paris agreement are in direct conflict with their charitable purposes i think this highlights the serious difficulties that arise if directly conflicting investments are automatically excluded by law first the vicechancellor only had in mind the relatively simple cases of cancer charities not investing in tobacco or the quakers not investing in armaments companies one would expect that such the honourable mr justice michael green approved judgment butlersloss and ors v charity commission for england and wales and anor investments would probably be expressly excluded in the charity’s trust deed or governing constitution not only did the vicechancellor not contemplate this sort of case but also he clearly thought that the straightforward cases that he did refer to would not affect greatly the overall investable universe of that charity the second point is both the adequacy of the definition for identifying directly conflicting investments and whether the definition that has been adopted will actually in practical terms pick up all such investments in respect of the latter i am thinking about the lack of information concerning scope emissions it seems to me that the vicechancellor was not as a matter of law distinguishing between a category case of direct conflict and a category case of indirect conflict while he does say that in a case of direct conflict the trustees “should not so invest” he goes on to say that “carried to its logical conclusion the trustees should take this course even if it would be likely to result in significant financial detriment to the charity” but then concludes that this is “unlikely to arise in practice” no authority is relied upon by the vicechancellor for saying there is an absolute prohibition and he does not appear to be saying that that is the legal conclusion that he comes to rather he is explaining the unlikelihood of there being any sort of financial detriment if trustees excluded directly conflicting investments the vicechancellor then goes on to explain the balancing exercise that trustees must perform in considering the indirect effect of particular investments on beneficiaries or donors there is nothing controversial about this nor is there in what he says about moral considerations in category but the way the vicechancellor framed the issues he was considering was that they were departures from the “starting point” of maximising financial returns if that is the starting point then i find it difficult to see how it should be ignored completely when there is a potential direct conflict if there is an absolute prohibition on directly conflicting investments then it would mean that this is the first question that trustees must ask and that presumably they are under a duty to do so again i do not think that the vicechancellor intended to be so categoric and his use of the word “should” means something slightly less than “must” and does not preclude consideration of other important factors it is just that a direct conflict is likely to be the most significant factor and should be avoided if possible but where there are
