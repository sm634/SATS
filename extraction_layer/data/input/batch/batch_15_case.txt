doubt as to the nature of the trustees’ powers and the trustees have decided how they want to exercise them but because the decision is particularly momentous the trustees wish to obtain the blessing of the court for the action on which they have resolved and which is within their powers in a case like that there is no question of surrender of discretion and indeed it is most unlikely that the court will be persuaded in the absence of special circumstances to accept the surrender of discretion on a question of that sort where the trustees are prima facie in a much better position than the court to know what is in the best interests of the beneficiaries” in re f guernsey court of appeal unreported th september mr john martin qc sitting as a judge of the guernsey court of appeal explained the distinction between categories and of public trustee v cooper the latter being where trustees surrender their discretion to the court because they are unable themselves to make the decision mr martin qc said of category “in the second type of application however the court is not exercising a discretion what it is doing is in effect making a declaration that the trustees proposed exercise of the power is lawful in other words that the proposed exercise is within the proper ambit of the power that the trustees are acting honestly and that in reaching their decision the trustees have taken into account all relevant matters have taken into account no irrelevant matters and have not reached a decision that no reasonable body of trustees could have reached the effect is to protect the trustees from any challenge to their decision by persons interested in the trust and to make clear that the trustees are entitled to indemnity from the trust assets in respect of the costs or other financial consequences of their decision it is immaterial that the court had it been exercising a discretion of its own would have exercised it in a way different from that proposed by the trustees to the extent that the court has any discretion it is in whether or not to admit the application if for example the court considers that the trustees decision is of insufficient moment it may refuse to entertain the application at all once it has decided to deal with the application however it has no more discretion than in the making of any other declaration and will make it once satisfied of the propriety of the proposed exercise of the power see also the helpful summary from snowden j as he then was in charity commission v mountstar ch at the honourable mr justice michael green approved judgment butlersloss and ors v charity commission for england and wales and anor mr henderson took the point that the evidence in relation to the ashden trust showed that the trustees had not actually decided to approve the proposed investment policy and so there was no decision on which the court could give its blessing there was correspondence on this point with the claimants’ solicitors in the runup to this hearing from which it is reasonably clear that the claimants had formed the opinion that they should adopt the proposed investment policy subject to the court’s approval ms butlersloss’ witness statement at paragraph had stated that it had not yet been formally approved by the trustees whereas mr sainsbury had said in paragraph of his witness statement that the mark leonard trustees do “intend to adopt the proposed investment policy subject to the court’s approval” mr cumming qc confirmed in oral submissions that the position in relation to the ashden trust was the same as for the mark leonard trust if this is a point on jurisdiction in relation to category of public trustee v cooper then i think it is a bad one being based purely on semantics and possibly the need for a minute recording the decision the claimants have clearly decided to adopt the proposed investment policy if the court gives its blessing to their decision to do so but i think mr henderson was relying on this so as to make a
