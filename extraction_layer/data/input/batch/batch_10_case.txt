approved judgment butlersloss and ors v charity commission for england and wales and anor growth which is consistent with commercial prudence that is the starting point for all charity trustees when considering the exercise of investment powers most charities need money and the more of it there is available the more the trustees can seek to accomplish in most cases this prima facie position will govern the trustees’ conduct in most cases the best interests of the charity require that the trustees’ choice of investments should be made solely on the basis of wellestablished investment criteria having taken expert advice where appropriate and having due regard to such matters as the need to diversify the need to balance income against capital growth and the need to balance risk against return” the vicechancellor then went on to consider what have subsequently been categorised into three exceptions to the general rule perhaps more accurately they should be described as situations where the “starting point” is not necessarily the end point and other considerations can come into play the vicechancellor considered that these would only be “comparatively rare” cases the first is of direct conflict with the charity’s purposes the claimants say that this is the category with which this case is concerned the vicechancellor had in mind the straightforward conflicts exemplified by cancer research charities investing in tobacco shares temperance charities in brewerydistillery shares and quakers in armaments companies in relation to these situations the vicechancellor said emphasis added “if as would be likely in those examples trustees were satisfied that investing in a company engaged in a particular type of business would conflict with the very objects the charity is seeking to achieve they should not so invest carried to its logical conclusion the trustees should take this course even if it would be likely to result in significant financial detriment to the charity the logical conclusion whilst sound as a matter of legal analysis is unlikely to arise in practice it is not easy to think of an instance where in practice the exclusion for this reason of one or more companies or sectors from the whole range of investments open to trustees would be likely to leave them without an adequately wide range of investments from which to choose a properly diversified portfolio” there was much debate before me as to whether by using the word “should” the vicechancellor was holding that there was an absolute prohibition on investments that directly conflict with the charity’s purposes it seems to me important that the context of the vicechancellor’s holding is that he thought that in practice there would not be a significant financial detriment in such cases of direct conflict he could not have contemplated the current case where there is potential exclusion of a large number of possible investments on the basis that they do directly conflict with the charities’ purposes the second category which has been termed “indirect conflicts” is where the proposed investments might alienate supporters or donors to the charity or make recipients from the charity less willing to be helped the vicechancellor seemed to consider that this would also be comparatively rare but that in this situation the trustees would have to balance the risks involved at pab he said the honourable mr justice michael green approved judgment butlersloss and ors v charity commission for england and wales and anor “…the trustees will need to balance the difficulties they would encounter or the likely financial loss they would sustain if they were to hold the investments against the risk of financial detriment if those investments were excluded from their portfolio the greater the risk of financial detriment the more certain the trustees should be of countervailing disadvantages to the charity before they incur that risk” the vicechancellor then suggested that there may be other cases “where trustees are justified in departing from what would otherwise be their starting point” but he did not elaborate on what they might be he did explain however and this is the third category that investment decisions should not be made by taking into account moral considerations particularly where that causes financial detriment to the charity at pe he said
