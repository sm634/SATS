brought by the then bishop of oxford and two other priests against the church commissioners in relation to their investment policy concerning south africa the case was heard in at the time south africa was transitioning to democracy and there were a range of views within the church of england about the appropriateness of investing in south africa while there has been understandable focus on the vicechancellor’s general exposition of the law relating to the exercise of charitable trustees’ investment powers it is important not to overlook the actual decision that he made the church commissioners’ charitable objects were “financial assistance for clergy of the church of england” in that sense the bishop of oxford who was himself a church commissioner and the other claimants could be said to be beneficiaries the church commissioners already had in place an ethical investment policy that the honourable mr justice michael green approved judgment butlersloss and ors v charity commission for england and wales and anor excluded investments in armaments gambling tobacco and newspapers they also had an express policy in relation to investments in south african companies but the claimants considered that it did not go far enough and sought stricter investment criteria for such investments however the actual declarations that they were asking the court to make did not refer to south africa and were in quite general terms pbc “ that the commissioners…are obliged to have regard to the object of promoting the christian faith through the established church of england and that in the exercise of those functions…may not act in a manner which would be incompatible with that object” the vicechancellor refused to make both declarations on the grounds of their ambiguity and lack of necessity he said that the church commissioners had had regard to their objects as shown by their adoption of their ethical investment policy furthermore he said ““have regard to the object” is a loose phrase and there is a real danger it will mean all things to all men” he also rejected the second declaration on the basis that it would not assist the church commissioners in that “it would not deal with how the commissioners should proceed when confronted with differing views on whether on moral grounds a proper investment is in conflict with the objects the commissioners are seeking to promote” that was the actual decision of the vicechancellor but it has been the general principles as to the exercise of investment powers by charity trustees that has been influential and informed decisionmaking as to investment policy ever since including the basis for the cc guidance on ethical investment it is technically obiter dicta but given the great standing of the vicechancellor in this field and the rarity of such cases getting to court the judgment deserves the utmost respect at pab the vicechancellor set out the fundamental principle underlying the exercise of any power by charity trustees “it is axiomatic that charity trustees in common with all other trustees are concerned to further the purposes of the trust of which they have accepted the office of trustee that is their duty to enable them better to discharge that duty trustees have powers vested in them those powers must be exercised for the purpose for which they have been given to further the purposes of the trust that is the guiding principle applicable to the issues in these proceedings everything which follows is no more than the reasoned application of that principle in particular contexts” dealing specifically with the power of investment the vicechancellor said that maximising financial return is the “starting point” because charities always need more money at pde he said “…prima facie the purposes of the trust will be best served by the trustees seeking to obtain therefrom the maximum return whether by way of income or capital the charity commission for instance in its draft legal underpinning document dated march had originally suggested that the vicechancellor only intended to deal with trusts that had a permanent endowment and therefore a duty to invest however at the hearing it accepted that the principles set out by the vicechancellor are not so limited the honourable mr justice michael green
