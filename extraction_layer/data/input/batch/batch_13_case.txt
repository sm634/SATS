the practical difficulties around identifying which companies are in fact acting in conflict with the charity’s purposes it cannot be the case that the failure to identify such companies may constitute a breach of trust my view as to what the vicechancellor meant is fortified a little by his rejection of the second declaration that the bishop of oxford was seeking namely that the church commissioners “may not act in a manner which would be incompatible with that object” which was promoting the christian faith through the established church of england that declaration was principally not made because he thought that there could well be differing moral views within the church as to whether particular investments were in conflict with the charity’s purpose see ph but if he thought that there was an absolute prohibition on acting in conflict with the charity’s purposes there should be nothing wrong with a declaration in those terms which would only express what the church commissioners were bound to do anyway he expressly states at pa that he “was referred to no authority bearing directly on these matters” the honourable mr justice michael green approved judgment butlersloss and ors v charity commission for england and wales and anor where conflicts arise whether in trusts or in companies they can be resolved by the consent of the beneficiaries or the shareholders there is no absolute prohibition by law to entering transactions that involve a conflict the trouble with charities is that there are no beneficiaries as such who can give consent save for the attorney general acting in the public interest and in my view that adds weight to the conclusion that these are matters for the discretion of the trustees acting consistently with and so as to further the purposes of the trust even if i am wrong about what the vicechancellor was saying and he was saying that there is an absolute prohibition on direct conflicts i agree with mr henderson that with all due respect such a dictum should not be followed it is understandable that the claimants felt that there was sufficient uncertainty around what the vicechancellor meant so as to require them to seek clarity from the court in this respect their case brings sharply into focus what the vicechancellor actually meant in relation to direct conflicts because of the difficulties of establishing whether a direct conflict actually exists but for the same reasons as set out above i do not believe that the passage of the vicechancellor’s judgment should be read as imposing as a matter of law an absolute prohibition against directly conflicting investments it will all depend on the particular facts of the case but the trustees have a discretion in relation to the exercise of their powers of investment and that includes in relation to potential situations of direct conflict this seems to have been the view of the charity commission as expressed in cc and the submissions of mr jaffey qc it is also the position of the attorney general who if anyone would be expected to support an absolute prohibition if that was thought to be in the public interest but mr henderson was quite clear that this was a discretionary decision by the trustees which has to be made with regard to their overarching duty to further the purposes of the charity and mr cumming qc also preferred that view of the bishop of oxford case in terms of what the law should be albeit that as i said above he understandably wanted the comfort of this being clarified by the court the real area of dispute was therefore not about this but about whether the claimants should have the declarations they seek and whether they have in fact carried out the necessary balancing exercise in relation to their decision to adopt the proposed investment policy such that the court should bless their decision that is dealt with below but before turning to the declarations themselves i should summarise what i consider to be the law in relation to charity trustees taking into account nonfinancial considerations when exercising their powers of investment trustees’ powers of investment derive from the trust deeds or governing
