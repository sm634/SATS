proposed investment policy and this seeks to ensure that the charities’ investments are aligned with the goals of the paris agreement and thereby avoid direct conflict with their charitable purposes the ashden trust policy is dated april and the mark leonard trust policy is dated april the proposed investment policy begins with a “statement of investment beliefs” it states “through grant giving the trust supports the development of sustainable resilient and equitable societies as well as requiring an investment return to fund its charitable giving the trust has a duty to act in the longterm interests of its charitable purposes in this fiduciary role the trustees wish to make investments that will provide a good riskadjusted return and that do not conflict with the trust’s charitable purposes or adversely affect the issues that the trust through its charitable giving seeks to address” it then continued to set out the risks of not doing anything to tackle climate change a little later in the same section the proposed investment policy stated “the trustees also consider that investments in sustainable sectors and climate solutions provide opportunities to increase the trust’s financial return and support its charitable objectives zero and low carbon technologies energy resource efficiency and nature based solutions and adaptation investments will continue to grow in the developed and developing world the trustees seek to increase their exposure to these investments” under the heading “investment goals and objectives” it stated “to protect and enhance the trust’s financial returns and support its charitable objectives the trust aims to align its investments with the paris climate agreement in other words the trust’s total investment portfolio should be constructed on the basis that its ghg greenhouse gas emissions are aligned with the longterm global warming target of well below °c and preferably °c above preindustrial levels accepting that individual investments will differ in their carbon intensity the investment objective for the trust is to generate capital growth in excess of inflation over the long term whilst generating a sustainable spending level to support the trust’s ongoing grant making activities the trustees wish to express their overall investment return objective as uk consumer price inflation cpi per annum on average over five year rolling periods the return objective will be reviewed regularly the trustees are comfortable with meeting their spending needs from a combination of income and capital and therefore have adopted a total return approach to investing” there is an obvious difficulty in defining which investments are or are not aligned with the goals of the paris agreement the paris agreement itself does not attempt to do that and as mr jaffey qc submitted and as stated above it only purports to bind its signatories and it does not impose obligations on other parties or charities the honourable mr justice michael green approved judgment butlersloss and ors v charity commission for england and wales and anor nevertheless the claimants have chosen to use the goals of the paris agreement as the basis for the formulation of the proposed investment policy the “investment guidelines” attempt to spell this out as follows • “constrain the portfolio’s exposure to sectors highly exposed to climate change see investment exclusions • on average a minimum of a yearly reduction in ghg emissions intensity until • starting from a minimum reduction in ghg emissions intensity compared to the market index and an absolute reduction of by • at least four times more green assets than the market index of brown assets • scope emissions analysis should be factored in over the next four years” the greenhouse gas protocol which was developed by the world resources institute sets out internationally accepted greenhouse gas accounting and reporting standards for companies and organisations so as to provide transparency in relation to ghg emissions it divides emissions into three scopes scope emissions are direct emissions under the direct control of the company scope emissions cover indirect emissions which include the production and use of energy by the company and scope emissions cover all other indirect emissions which are a consequence of a company’s value and supply chain activities presently scope reporting by companies is optional and it is therefore difficult to measure the last
