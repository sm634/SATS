wider point that the claimants should have set out clearly in their record of decisionmaking the basis for that decision in other words they should have explained the factors that they took into account the balancing exercise that they undertook and generally how they concluded that their discretion should be exercised in favour of adopting the proposed investment policy this feeds into the substantive objections expressed by both mr jaffey qc and mr henderson as to whether the evidence of the claimants as to their carrying out of the necessary balancing exercise is sufficient for the court to be able to approve their decision to adopt the proposed investment policy their principal objection it seems to me is as to whether adequate account has been taken of the financial effect of the proposed investment policy they accept i think that the claimants have carefully considered the potential conflict with their charitable purposes of investing in companies that are not aligned with the goals of the paris agreement they might not agree that the paris agreement is necessarily the best way for the conflict to be tested but i do not think there could be any basis for suggesting that the claimants had not thought about and researched this responsibly and diligently including taking into account specialist advice their concerns are focused on the other side of the equation namely whether the trustees have adequately balanced the anticipated financial detriment that would be suffered by the adoption of the proposed investment policy i think part of the problem in this case is that the claimants’ evidence and consideration of these matters were dependent on two alternative views of the law arising out of the bishop of oxford case if the absolutist interpretation that all directly conflicting investments were automatically excluded was correct then the claimants needed a workable definition of what are directly conflicting investments they came up with investments that were misaligned with the goals of the paris agreement on that scenario there was no need to work out the financial implications but if as i have found there is no absolute prohibition and the claimants have to perform a discretionary exercise there needs to be balanced against the potentially conflicting investments the risk of financial detriment from implementation of that policy the honourable mr justice michael green approved judgment butlersloss and ors v charity commission for england and wales and anor mr jaffey qc and mr henderson submitted that the claimants have not yet struck this balance or if they have their doing so has not been explained either in the evidence or recorded in the minutes of a trustees’ meeting i think the trustees would have been well advised to have set out their reasons for adopting the proposed investment policy in principle but i do not accept that they have not provided adequate reasons in particular as to the financial effect of the proposed investment policy it is explained in the policy itself what the investment goals and objectives are in particular an investment return of cpi pa on average over five year rolling periods the proposed portfolios put forward by cazenove are dealt with in paragraphs to above and take into account that investment return objective which cazenove considered attainable ms butlersloss explained in her witness statement that there might be a “risk of short term financial detriment because of the substantially more limited investable universe and sectors in which the proposed investment policy permits investments the longer the time frame over which this is assessed the higher the likelihood of the return objective being achieved and the trust avoiding diminished returns as a result of the contemplated change of approach” i have quoted from of her witness statement in paragraph above it seems to me that the claimants have very much in mind the potential financial effect of the proposed investment policy they cannot be more precise as to the figures because things change rapidly and furthermore there remains uncertainty about the effect of further scope emissions data affecting the investable universe mr jaffey qc submitted that there is no evidence of the claimants considering alternative strategies such as engaging with companies as a shareholder
