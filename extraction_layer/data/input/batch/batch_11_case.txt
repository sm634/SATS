“trustees must not use property held by them for investment purposes as a means for making moral statements at the expense of the charity of which they are trustees those who wish may do so with their own property but that is not a proper function of trustees with trust assets held as an investment” he then expanded on the question of differing moral opinions at pg “trustees may if they wish accommodate the views of those who consider that on moral grounds a particular investment would be in conflict with the objects of the charity so long as the trustees are satisfied that course would not involve a risk of significant financial detriment” the boundaries of law and morality are sometimes difficult to define and perhaps even more so in the context of charities which are often underpinned by a strong sense of moral imperative but decisions by trustees have to be legally justifiable in the case of charities s of the charities act requires charity trustees to obtain the approval of the charity commission the attorney general or the high court when they “regard themselves as being under a moral obligation” to make a payment or refuse a gift in other words acting pursuant to what the trustees perceive to be a “moral obligation” will be carefully supervised this is in line with the vicechancellor limiting the involvement of morality in trustees’ decisionmaking and the vicechancellor had had cited to him the case of re snowden ch in which there was discussion as to whether the attorney general or the court had power to approve a payment which is motivated purely by the trustees feeling under a moral obligation to make the payment so the circumscribing of decisions by trustees taken on moral grounds is not new and continues to be a constraint on the exercise of the power of investment mr jaffey qc took me to the supreme court decision in r palestinian solidarity campaign ltd and anor v secretary of state for housing communities and local government wlr where both lord wilson and lord carnwath jjsc expressly approved a statement in the law commission’s report entitled fiduciary duties of investment intermediaries law com no as to when trustees lady arden and lord sales jjsc dissented but not on this point the honourable mr justice michael green approved judgment butlersloss and ors v charity commission for england and wales and anor these were pension trustees can take into account nonfinancial factors in relation to investment decisions lord carnwath said that trustees “may take nonfinancial considerations into account – “provided that doing so would not involve significant risk of financial detriment to the scheme and where they have good reason to think that scheme members would support their decision”” mr cumming qc submitted that there may be a difference between “significant risk of financial detriment” and “a risk of significant financial detriment” as the vicechancellor put it mr jaffey qc put forward a thesis based on the bishop of oxford case that trustees should reverse through the categories when deciding on their investment policy so starting with category he submitted that trustees had first to work out whether the proposed investment policy risked significant financial detriment over the period of investment if so moral considerations could not play a part in their decision whether to adopt the policy they would then move to category and consider whether the charity might lose supporters or beneficiaries if the policy was not adopted and balance that against the likely investment returns finally they would turn to category and if investments are thought to conflict with the charity’s objects then they need not be made even if there is a risk of significant financial detriment while there is a certain neatness to it i am not persuaded by this schematic approach to trustees’ decisionmaking in this area and i do not consider that this was what was contemplated by the vicechancellor in the bishop of oxford case similarly i do not think that the vicechancellor was laying down either what “significant financial detriment” actually meant or that it was any form of threshold test that the trustees had to consider before anything
