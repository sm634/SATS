should charities whose principal purposes are environmental protection and improvement and the relief of poverty be able to adopt an investment policy that excludes many potential investments because the trustees consider that they conflict with their charitable purposes one might be forgiven for thinking that the answer should obviously be that such a policy would be entirely appropriate but because of uncertainty over the reach of the only leading case in this area – harries v church commissioners for england wlr a decision of sir donald nicholls vc as he then was commonly referred to as the bishop of oxford case – and the fact that this is a very important decision for them the claimants who are the trustees of two such charities seek the court’s blessing for the adoption of their new investment policies the two charities are the ashden trust and the mark leonard trust both are part of the sainsbury family charitable trusts network they have approximately £m and £m respectively by way of assets the first claimant ms sarah butlersloss is the settlor and a trustee of the ashden trust her brother the fifth claimant mr mark sainsbury is the settlor and a trustee of the mark leonard trust both charities work closely together having similar purposes and sharing staff and the same investment manager cazenove capital management cazenove the application is brought principally under what is known as category within the four categories described in public trustee v cooper wtlr public trustee v cooper the claimants who are all the trustees of the two charities seek the court’s approval for the adoption of their proposed new investment policies to ensure that they are acting lawfully in such respect they also seek a series of declarations as to the proper approach to be taken in relation to such issues generally by charity trustees i will deal with whether that is appropriate relief to be seeking from the court later in this judgment on april i gave permission to the claimants to bring these proceedings pursuant to s of the charities act because i considered that the charity commission had refused permission the defendants are the charity commission for england and wales and the attorney general each of whom are separately represented both invite the court to deliver a judgment that sets out the correct approach in law for charity trustees to follow in considering adopting an ethical or responsible investment policy but say that it is premature for the court to approve these investment policies based on the available evidence everyone recognises that there needs to be clarification as to the effect of the bishop of oxford case and i will endeavour to provide that but it is important not to lose sight of the fact that this is a specific application by these charities in relation to their proposed new investment policies and i will be determining the issues before me in that context i have been greatly assisted by the written and oral submissions by counsel and their legal teams mr edward cumming qc with mr maxim cardew appeared on behalf of the honourable mr justice michael green approved judgment butlersloss and ors v charity commission for england and wales and anor the claimants mr ben jaffey qc appeared on behalf of the charity commission and mr william henderson appeared on behalf of the attorney general context the method that the claimants have chosen for identifying the investments that the charities should invest in is whether they are aligned with the paris climate agreement which was signed on april under the united nations framework convention on climate change the paris agreement there are countries that are parties to the paris agreement with of them having ratified it the principal goal of the paris agreement is to limit global warming to well below °c above preindustrial levels and pursuing efforts to limit it further to °c it aims to do this by reducing greenhouse gas emissions and fostering climate resilience and sustainable development paragraph c of article to the paris agreement is particularly pertinent as it states “c making finance flows consistent with a pathway towards low greenhouse gas emissions and climate resilient development”
